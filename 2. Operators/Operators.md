### Arithmetic Operators

The aritmetic operator are: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`.
With them we can perform mathematical operations.

```csharp
5 + 3 // 8
7 - 2 // 5
2 * 4 // 8
6 / 2 // 3
```

`%` is the modulus operator. It returns us the remainder of a division. 

```csharp
5 % 2  // Remainder = 1 => 5 divided by 2 gives a remainder of 1
```


Note:
The **remainder** of a division is the amount left over after dividing one number by another when the division is not exact.
