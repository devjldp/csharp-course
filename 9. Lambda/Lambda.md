# Lambda Expressions


## What is a lambda expression?

A lambda expression is a concise way to write anonymus functions. It is often used with delegates, LINQ expressions, and higher order methods.

We use the `=>` operator to separate the input parameters from the expression or statement block that forms the body.

() => Console.WriteLine("Say Hello!");
