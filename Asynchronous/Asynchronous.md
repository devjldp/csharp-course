# Asynchronous Programming
Asynchronous programming allows a program to continue executing other tasks while waiting for long-running operations (e.g., file I/O, database calls, API requests) to complete. It prevents blocking the main thread, making applications more responsive.

**Key Concepts:**
* Uses async and await keywords.
* Returns a Task instead of blocking execution without freezing the main application.
* Asynchronous operations typically donâ€™t create additional threads.
* Works well with I/O-bound operations (e.g., network calls, file reading).
